What is CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to design the webpage to make it attractive. The reason for using CSS is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.

There are three types of CSS which are given below:

Inline CSS: In Inline CSS, we add the style to the tags using the “style” attribute inside the tag which we want to design.
Internal or Embedded CSS: Internal CSS allows us to style our page by adding the <style> tag inside the <head> tag. Inside the <style> tag, we add the design that we want to give to our page.
External CSS: External CSS lets us add style to our HTML page externally. We can add our styles in a different file with extension .css and link this page to our HTML page.
